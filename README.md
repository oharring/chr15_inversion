# chr15_inversion

Scripts for Hager, Harringmeyer et al. 2022

neutral_simulations_demography.slim: slim script to explore the fit of 8 different _fastsimcoal2_ demographic models

selection_simulations.slim: slim script to estimate selection on the inversion

age_of_inversion_simulations.slim: slim script to estimate the age of the inversion

recombination_effects_inversion.slim: slim script to estimate the average fitness of forest population when the inversion suppresses recombination between two beneficial mutations (and deleterious mutations)

recombination_effects_twolocus_model.slim: slim script to estimate the average fitness of forest population with two beneficial mutations (and deleterious mutations) are found on a non-inverted haplotype
